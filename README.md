Git Time Machine
=================

Time machine for Github files

## TODO

- Can requests be made with &until= and &since= in same request?
- Double check getting 'newer' commits works
- Resort after updating commits list?
- DRY up fetching of older/newer commits
- Render list of commits in a timeline at the top of the page
- Chrome app to link directly from GH
- Check how it works with branches
- Authenticate requests https://gist.github.com/hannestyden/563893

## NOTES

- The github 'sha' can also be a branch
